# Google-home-nanoleaf-integration
This is a project to integrate google home commands with nanoleaf wall lights 

Currently researching how to access / change google home commands and how I can access my nanoleaf lights. 

The nanoleaf lights are already integrated with google assistant on mobile devices, but there seems to be an issue with local device pairing with the two devices so I'll have to use the cloud that google home api uses as well as learning the api for nanoleaf that integrates with the cloud.
